For using nodemon to solve the watch issue

Meenakshi Â· Lecture 28 
I tried using the follwoing changes in json file and was able to watch by using nodemon.

"main": "main.scss",
  "scripts": {
    "build-css":"node-sass --include-path scss sass/main.scss css/style.css",
    "watch-css":"nodemon -e scss -x \"npm run build-css\""
  },



in the terminal use:

npm run build-css

or to watch:

npm run watch-css
