I tried using the follwoing changes in json file and was able to watch by using nodemon.

"main": "main.scss",
  "scripts": {
    "build-css":"node-sass --include-path scss sass/main.scss css/style.css",
    "watch-css":"nodemon -e scss -x \"npm run build-css\""
  },



-in the terminal use first:

npm run build-css

-and to watch:

npm run watch-css

-to run live server:
live-server
